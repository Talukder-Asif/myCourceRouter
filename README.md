Answer:

* It is a responsive website.
* In mobile, you will get a button, If you click that button then the cart part will show.
* If you cross the limit of cradit (20), then website will give you a warning using toast.

#### Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.

Answer: First, I created a fake JSON file with the help of chatGTP AI. But that wasn't enough for this website. Then I searched on Google and found some common course names and course-related pictures. Next, I cropped all the images in the same width. Then I reduced the image size by optimizing the image with a website.

This assignment is very challenging for me because I also have mid-term exams. But I tried to handle both sides. The next day, I made a structure of the website, and I showed all the curses in the website. Then I prepare for my exam. After some time, some ideas hit my brain, I easily created cart parts and made dynamic them with useEffect and useState. But I was a little wary about the condition and the toast. Then I made a plan to use vanila JS for the condition and watch some youtube videos about toast. And my plan is work properly. I wanted to make fully responsive website, But it was looking bad for mobile devices because of the cart part. So I make a plan to show the cart part if someone hits a button, I think about this sometimes, and then I make it with VanilaJS. Now, 16/09/2023, 9.53 PH. I am writing this readme file And I will submit my assignment very soon. This is a challinging assignment for my coz today I give exam on Computer Architecture and Organization, and tomorrow I will give Data Structure exam. So it was a challenge submit this assignment on time with bonus part. Because I was miss 2 modiule and one conceptual seassion. I have finnish all the classes and then start this assignment.
